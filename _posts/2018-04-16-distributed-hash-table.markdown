Came across distributed hash tables when trying to *lookup* on key value stores.

A Distributed Hash Table is a structure which supports lookup/resource discovery in large peer-to-peer distributed systems, where storage and lookups are distributed among multiple machines.

It is a building block for peer-to-peer applications.

#### Peer-to-Peer
It is a distributed system architecture without any centralized control and without the use of centralized services, where the nodes are symmetric in function.

#### Properties of a DHT
+ Decentralized
+ Scalable
+ Efficient: Find items quickly
+ Dynamic: Nodes can fail, new nodes can join
+ General-purpose: Flexible naming
