Hello World Again!

For no particular reason, I seem to have completely stopped blogging over the last 2 or more years. I have been learning new things which I should have been noting down. But somehow, for every one of these topics, I have either not felt like writing or did not get time to write *while* I was learning and when I do get the time a few weeks later, I lose the motivation and have also moved on to a different topic.

Many times, I start on a post and write a good bit of it, only to never finish that last 20\% which always takes more time than the first 80\%.

Now, I have decided to start afresh. I am starting by first changing my blog theme to [Niklas Buschmann's amazing contrast theme](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast), which is exactly as minimal as I've always wanted.

More importantly, I hope to write more frequently (though anything is more frequent than 0). I hope to allocate some time to note down my thoughts and learnings on whichever interesting topic I am working on and will hopefully push through the last 20\% as well to actually finish some blog posts.

Wishing myself luck!
