Heard about this really awesome python library which provides interactive command lines. Wanted to write about it, so that I can remember its existance.

[prompt_toolkit](http://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) can be installed using

```
$ pip install prompt_toolkit
```

It provides great features like Emacs and Vi keybindings, syntax highlighting when typing, mouse support for cursor positioning and auto suggestions to name some.

These would make any python command line utility, beautiful and easy to use.

The documentation is also really good and it takes hardly 10 mins to write a basic testing program.
